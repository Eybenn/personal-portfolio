                >—a former licensed aircraft mechanic who graduated from PATTS
                College of Aeronautics. But guess what? I've taken a bold leap
                into a whole new world as a career shifter, with zero prior
                knowledge, striving to become a successful full-stack web
                developer! When it comes to choosing my peers, I'm pretty
                selective—just like the saying goes,
                <q
                  >"Tell me who your friends are, and I'll tell you who you
                  are."</q
                >
                I love playing video games, and fun fact: during the pandemic, I
                even tried my hand at becoming a professional e-sports player! I
                set myself a time frame—if nothing happened, I'd quit. And,
                well… here we are! Sports? Oh, I dabble in a bunch—basketball,
                volleyball, golf, badminton, chess, table tennis, and more. Not
                saying I'm great at them, I just love trying new things! Lately,
                I've been thinking about getting into shooting as a hobby. At
                first glance, you might think I'm the serious type, but I
                promise I'm not! I just don't go around randomly approaching
                people. That's just a little glimpse of me—hope you enjoyed
                getting to know me!
